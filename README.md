Clustering Project

Goal:
Find causes of error in Zillow Zestimates.

I will deliver the following: 

acquire.py- Query the Sql database for 2017 properties.

wrangle.py- File to filter out for unique parcelid and latest transaction data. Look for single unit properties, handle missing values, filter for outliers, and drop unwanted columns

main.ipynb-File to run functions from previous two files and move onto exploration. Began with testing and moved on to clustering.
